Alternate way of writing playRound code:

if (playerSelection === computerSelection) {    // Tie
    return `It's a tie! You both chose ${playerSelection}`;
} 

// Not a tie:

// Player chooses rock
else if (playerSelection === "rock" && computerSelection === "paper") {
    return "You Lose! Paper beats Rock";
}
else if (playerSelection === "rock" && computerSelection === "scissors") {
    return "You Win! Rock beats Scissors";
}

// Player chooses paper
else if (playerSelection === "paper" && computerSelection === "rock") {
    return "You Win! Paper beats Rock";
}
else if (playerSelection === "paper" && computerSelection === "scissors") {
    return "You Lose! Scissors beats Paper";
}

// Player chooses scissors
else if (playerSelection === "scissors" && computerSelection === "rock") {
    return "You Lose! Rock beats Scissors";
}
else if (playerSelection === "scissors" && computerSelection === "paper") {
    return "You Win! Scissors beats Paper";
}
